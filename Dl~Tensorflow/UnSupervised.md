    Overview of Unsupervised Learning

        Clustering
            Grouping data point into clusters
            Similar data points in cluster
            Example: k-means clustering are hierarchically clustering
        
        Assocaiaition
            Finding relationship between variable in large datasets
            Commonly used in market basket analysis
            Example: A priori algorithm & Eclat algorithm

        Dimensionality reduction
            Reducing number of random variable
            Obtaining prinicipal variables in
            Example: Principal component analysis (PCA) & t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE)

        
        Autoencoder => A  neural network for  dimensionality reduction or feature learning
                Trained to reduce the input & recostructed output


        GAN (Generative Adverseal Netowork):
            Two network:
                Generator -> Generate new data instance
                Discriminator -> Evaluate the authencity of Generator data
